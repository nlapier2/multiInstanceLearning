# Multiple Instance Learning Code, 2016

This repository contains multiple instance learning research code developed by Nathan LaPierre, under Professor Huzefa Rangwala, from February to August 2016 at George Mason University. The only files excluded from this repository are large data files and the UCLUST executable.

The paper in the latex directory was submitted to BIBM 2016 (https://cci.drexel.edu/ieeebibm/bibm2016/). The paper describes CAMIL (Clustering and Assembly with Multiple Instance Learning), a pipeline for classifying patient phenotype, specifically meant to work with metagenomic data.
