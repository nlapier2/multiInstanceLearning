--------------------------------

K = 41 or K = 51 with read size limited to 100 seemed to work best. I chose K = 51.

GeneMark
- in progress for both all and out1

One read per cluster GICF
- write script to go through uclust file and fasta file, writing necessary lines to a new file
- iterate through each line in uclust and fasta files
- for each line in clustering file:
	- if the patient is new, create a list for that patient
	- if the cluster number is longer than length of list, or that list index is 0, write the fasta line to the new file
		- if list length was shorter than cluster number, lengthen list to that length
		- set value of that list index to 1
	- otherwise, list index value was 1, thus do not write the FASTA line to the file

Explicit association of clusters to labels with SVM-light
- take the prediction file and augment with explicit association with cluster labels and an example
- maybe augment with genemark results to predict genes that are most indicative of having or not having disease

Start writing my paper
- clarify direction of paper with rangwala
- start with parts of introduction and related work sections from class paper, maybe some of methods (UCLUST, SVM-light, etc)
- remember matplotlib for charts: http://matplotlib.org/

Same data as MGWAS paper?
- can start downloading other patients with bulk downloader, but still not all data is available
- may have to ask paper authors where to find all data
