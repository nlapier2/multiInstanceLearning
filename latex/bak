\subsection{Classification}

The problem of \emph{classification} involves grouping data points into two or more classes. In this case, this involves predicting whether or not a patient has a given disease. Since, in this study, we only worry about whether or not the patient has the disease (as opposed to, for instance, how severe their illness is), we have a two-class classification problem. Patients are sorted into the positive class (sick) or negative class (healthy). Common classification methods include logistic regression \cite{cox58} and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) \cite{vap95}, as well as numerous other methods. Here, we use a standard SVM implementation called svm-light \cite{joachims08}. The choice of classifier is not particularly important for D-BoW methods \cite{amores13}.
