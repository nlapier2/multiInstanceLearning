                                          <p>Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.</p>

abstract ={We describe a new computer system, calledARACHNE, for assembling genome sequence using paired-end whole-genome shotgun reads. ARACHNEhas several key features, including an efficient and sensitive procedure for finding read overlaps, a procedure for scoring overlaps that achieves high accuracy by correcting errors before assembly, read merger based on forward-reverse links, and detection of repeat contigs by forward-reverse link inconsistency. To testARACHNE, we created simulated reads providing ¿àº10-fold coverage of the genomes of H. influenzae, S. cerevisiae, and D. melanogaster, as well as human chromosomes 21 and 22. The assemblies of these simulated reads yielded nearly complete coverage of the respective genomes, with a small number of contigs joined into a smaller number of supercontigs (or scaffolds). For example, analysis of the D. melanogaster genome yielded ¿àº98% coverage with an N50 contig length of 324 kb and an N50 supercontig length of 5143 kb. The assembly accuracy was high, although not perfect: small errors occurred at a frequency of roughly 1 per 1 Mb (typically, deletion of ¿àº1 kb in size), with a very small number of other misassemblies. The assembly was rapid: the Drosophilaassembly required only 21 hours on a single 667 MHz processor and used 8.4 Gb of memory.},

To obtain an integrated view of the spatial and temporal distribution of the human microbiota, we surveyed bacteria from up to 27 sites in seven to nine healthy adults on four occasions. We found that community composition was determined primarily by body habitat. Within habitats, interpersonal variability was high, whereas individuals exhibited minimal temporal variability. Several skin locations harbored more diverse communities than the gut and mouth, and skin locations differed in their community assembly patterns. These results indicate that our microbiota, although personalized, varies systematically across body habitats and time; such trends may ultimately reveal how microbiome changes cause or prevent disease.

abstract = {Obtaining an unbiased view of the phylogenetic composition and functional diversity within a microbial community is one central objective of metagenomic analysis. New technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have dramatically reduced sequencing costs to a level where metagenomic analysis may become a viable alternative to more focused assessments of the phylogenetic (eg. 16S rDNA) and functional diversity of microbial communities. To determine whether the short ([~]100-200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities the results of BLAST and COG analyses were compared for long ([~]750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, BLASTX searches against GenBank nr found far fewer homologs within the short sequence library. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in BLASTX homolog detection. Only in cases where the long read sequence had a close homolog (low BLAST E-score) did the derived short read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short read sequences. Among COG hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72% of the COGs found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for analysis of short sequences, use of short read length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns and predictors of genital tract
	HIV-1 RNA levels during a 36-month period. METHODS: HIV-1 RNA levels
	were measured blood in plasma and the genital tract (by cervicovaginal
	lavage [CVL]) at baseline before highly, active antiretroviral therapy,
	at 2 and 4 weeks and every 6 months. Viral loads were measured using
	nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay with a lower limit
	of detection of 2.6 log10 copies/mL. RESULTS: Ninety-seven women
	had a median of 30.4 months' follow-up, with 530 paired PVL and CVL
	specimens. The strongest predictor of CVL fluid HIV-1 RNA detection
	was PVL of more than 2.6 log10 copies/mL, with an odds ratio of 13.7
	(P < 0.0001). Each log10 unit increase in PVL increased the odds
	of detecting HIV-1 RNA in CVL fluid by 2.6 folds (P = 0.0002). Cervicovaginal
	lavage fluid HIV-1 RNA exceeded PVL on 5\% of visits. When patients
	achieved undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA in both plasma and CVL
	fluid, rebound of HIV-1 RNA occurred in plasma first or concurrently
	with CVL fluid HIV-1 RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma viral load is the strongest
	predictor of CVL fluid HIV-1 RNA detection. Cervicovaginal lavage
	fluid HIV-1 RNA levels are generally lower than PVL. Plasma viral
	load is more likely to rebound first or at the same time as CVL fluid

  abstract = {We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial
	communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac,
	measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic
	tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads
	to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not
	both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly
	different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering
	and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions
	of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities
	between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying
	it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and
	environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice.
	Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and
	sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from
	sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and
	water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly
	with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the
	Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between
	terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and
	warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater
	samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment
	or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a
	new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth
	of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight
	into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among
	environments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Random community genomes (metagenomes) are now commonly
	used to study microbes in different environments. Over the past few
	years, the major challenge associated with metagenomics shifted from
	generating to analyzing sequences. High-throughput, low-cost next-generation
	sequencing has provided access to metagenomics to a wide range of
	researchers. RESULTS: A high-throughput pipeline has been constructed
	to provide high-performance computing to all researchers interested
	in using metagenomics. The pipeline produces automated functional
	assignments of sequences in the metagenome by comparing both protein
	and nucleotide databases. Phylogenetic and functional summaries of
	the metagenomes are generated, and tools for comparative metagenomics
	are incorporated into the standard views. User access is controlled
	to ensure data privacy, but the collaborative environment underpinning
	the service provides a framework for sharing datasets between multiple
	users. In the metagenomics RAST, all users retain full control of
	their data, and everything is available for download in a variety
	of formats. CONCLUSION: The open-source metagenomics RAST service
	provides a new paradigm for the annotation and analysis of metagenomes.
	With built-in support for multiple data sources and a back end that
	houses abstract data types, the metagenomics RAST is stable, extensible,
	and freely available to all researchers. This service has removed
	one of the primary bottlenecks in metagenome sequence analysis -
	the availability of high-performance computing for annotating the
	data. http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org.},

  abstract = {Although copious qualitative information describes the members of
	the diverse microbial communities on Earth, statistical approaches
	for quantifying and comparing the numbers and compositions of lineages
	in communities are lacking. We present a method that addresses the
	challenge of assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
	based on the genetic distances between sequences. We developed a
	computer program, DOTUR, which assigns sequences to OTUs by using
	either the furthest, average, or nearest neighbor algorithm for each
	distance level. DOTUR uses the frequency at which each OTU is observed
	to construct rarefaction and collector's curves for various measures
	of richness and diversity. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene libraries derived
	from Scottish and Amazonian soils and the Sargasso Sea with DOTUR,
	which assigned sequences to OTUs rapidly and reliably based on the
	genetic distances between sequences and identified previous inconsistencies
	and errors in assigning sequences to OTUs. An analysis of the two
	16S rRNA gene libraries from soil demonstrated that they do not contain
	enough sequences to support a claim that they contain different numbers
	of bacterial lineages with statistical confidence (P > 0.05), nor
	do they contain enough sequences to provide a robust estimate of
	species richness when an OTU is defined as containing sequences that
	are no more than 3\% different from each other. In contrast, the
	richness of OTUs at the 3\% level in the Sargasso Sea collection
	began to plateau after the sampling of 690 sequences. We anticipate
	that an equivalent extent of sampling for soil would require sampling
	more than 10,000 sequences, almost 100 times the size of typical
	sequence collections obtained from soil.},

	study compared the microbial community compositions of samples from
	two glaciers overlying differing bedrock. Bulk meltwater chemistry
	indicates that sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution account
	for 90\% of the solute flux from Bench Glacier, Alaska, whereas gypsum/anhydrite
	and carbonate dissolution accounts for the majority of the flux from
	John Evans Glacier, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. The microbial
	communities were examined using two techniques: clone libraries and
	dot blot hybridization of 16S rRNA genes. Two hundred twenty-seven
	clones containing amplified 16S rRNA genes were prepared from subglacial
	samples, and the gene sequences were analyzed phylogenetically. Although
	some phylogenetic groups, including the Betaproteobacteria, were
	abundant in clone libraries from both glaciers, other well-represented
	groups were found at only one glacier. Group-specific oligonucleotide
	probes were developed for two phylogenetic clusters that were of
	particular interest because of their abundance or inferred biochemical
	capabilities. These probes were used in quantitative dot blot hybridization
	assays with a range of samples from the two glaciers. In addition
	to shared phyla at both glaciers, each glacier also harbored a subglacial
	microbial population that correlated with the observed aqueous geochemistry.
	These results are consistent with the hypothesis that microbial activity
	is an important contributor to the solute flux from glaciers.},
