- Multi Instance Learning problem in bioinformatics
- We have a bunch of patients who are labeled as having a given disease or not
- We have many sequence reads for each patient, but these are not labeled
- Can we use bag/patient labels to determine label for each instance associated with that bag?
- Then aggregate instance values to predict bag labels
- Bag level prediction: predict whether or not new patients have the disease
- Instance prediction: show which species are correlated with the disease? Maybe what causes disease / possible treatments...
- This has been done before with short reviews on amazon/imdb/yelp
- Given bag/review label, determine individual sentence values and use to predict new reviews and sentences
- Problem: they had very man reviews/bags and few instances/sentences in each one
- Whereas we have relatively few patients (maybe thousands) but many (maybe millions) reads per patient
- So the main computational challenge here is that we need to find a way to allieviate this issue
- One method could be to cluster similar reads --> fewer instances/clusters per patient
- Another could be metagenome assembly: tie together reads that represent the same sequence --> fewer and longer sequences
- Once we figure out how to do this, we need to represent these instances as feature vectors
- Past literature has shown how to do this using convolutional neural nets
- Then apply a simple classifier, i.e. logistic regression or SVM. This has been done extensively in literature.
- The latter two parts are not the more innovative part
- Main idea: make MIL work for bioinformatics because we deal with the problem of many instances

Process:
- create vector representations of the instances (done in literature with CNN); then combine for whole bag
- optimize cost function with gradient descent (a good cost function has been proposed in literature)
- predict labels for any instance using classifier (we can use logistic regression or SVM)
- then we can predict group label by aggregating instance values

Involves: clustering/hashing, classification with regression/SVM, regularization (part of cost function), feature generation
